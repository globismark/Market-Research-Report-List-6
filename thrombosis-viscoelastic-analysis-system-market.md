<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thrombosis Viscoelastic Analysis System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thromboelastography (TEG)</li><li>Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thrombosis viscoelastic analysis system market encompasses two primary types: Thromboelastography (TEG) and Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM). TEG evaluates the clotting process by measuring the viscoelastic properties of blood as it forms and stabilizes clots, providing real-time insights into coagulation status. ROTEM functions similarly but employs a rotational mechanism to assess clot formation and dissolution, offering detailed information on various coagulation factors and dynamics. Both systems are crucial for diagnosing coagulopathies and guiding treatment in clinical settings.</p></p>
